    Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous (meat eating) mammals, of the family Felidae.[3][4][5] Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years.[6]

    Overview
    Domestic cats may be called "house cats" when kept as indoor pets.[7] They are one of the most popular pets in the world. Humans keep them for hunting mice and rats, and as friends. There are also farm cats, which keep mice and rats ; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans.[8] In 2021, there were about 220 million pet cats and 480 million feral cats in the world.[9][10][11]

    There are about 92 breeds of cat.[12] Domestic cats are found in shorthair, longhair, and hairless breeds. Cats which are not specific breeds can be referred to as 'domestic shorthair' (DSH) or 'domestic longhair' (DLH).

    The word 'cat' is also used for other felines, like lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, pumas, and cheetahs.

    History

    Past range of Felis silvestris.
    In the past, mostly in Egypt, people kept cats because the cats hunted and ate mice and rats. The oldest evidence of cats kept as pets is from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, around 7500 BC. Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and often mummified them so they could be with their owners "for all of eternity".[13]

    Today, people often keep cats as pets. There are also domestic cats which live without being cared for by people. These cats are called "feral cats" or "stray cats". The cats started becoming pets when the ancient Egyptians were around.

    Anatomy
    Cats have anatomy similar to the other members of the genus Felis. The genus has extra lumbar (lower back) and thoracic (chest) vertebrae. This helps explain why cats are very flexible. Unlike human arms, cat's front paws are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones. These allow cats to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.[14]

    The cat skull, unlike most mammals, has very large eye sockets and a powerful jaw.[15]: 35  Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth: this is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents.[16] Cats, like dogs, walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.[17]

    Cats walk very precisely. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a "pacing" gait (walking style); that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait will change to be a "diagonal" gait, similar to that of most other mammals: the diagonally opposite hind and forelegs will move at the same time.[18] Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws.[19] On the inside of the front paws there is something which looks like a sixth "finger". This special feature on the inside of the wrists is the carpal pad. The carpal pad is also found on other cats and on dogs.
