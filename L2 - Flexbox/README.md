# Lesson 2 - Flexbox Fundamentals

## Overview

This lesson introduces CSS Flexbox, a powerful layout method that makes it easy to create responsive designs. Students will learn how Flexbox relates to Figma's Auto Layout and how to translate responsive design concepts from design tools to code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will understand:

- The relationship between Figma's Auto Layout and CSS Flexbox
- Core Flexbox properties and their effects
- How to create responsive layouts using Flexbox
- Real-world applications of Flexbox in web development
- How to translate design mockups into functional CSS layouts

## Files in This Lesson

- **Justify Content**: Center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly
- **Align Items**: Center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch
- **Flex Properties**: Grow, shrink, wrap, and no-wrap
- **Perfect Centering**: Both horizontal and vertical alignment
- **Real-World Examples**: Navigation bars and card layouts

**Features:**

- Visual demonstrations with color-coded examples
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced
- Interactive examples students can modify
- Professional styling and layout

### `L2Simple.html` - Figma to CSS Exercise

A practical exercise that bridges design and development:

**Purpose:**

- Shows the connection between Figma's Auto Layout and CSS Flexbox
- Provides hands-on practice translating designs to code
- Includes a reference image from Figma
- Template for students to complete

**Exercise Structure:**

- Introduction explaining Figma → CSS relationship
- Reference image showing the target design
- Starter code with basic Flexbox setup
- Space for students to implement the solution

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Figma Auto Layout ↔ CSS Flexbox

- **Auto Layout in Figma** = **Flexbox in CSS**
- Both create responsive, flexible layouts
- Similar concepts: spacing, direction, alignment
- Design-to-code workflow understanding

### 2. Essential Flexbox Properties

#### Container Properties

```css
.flex-container {
    display: flex;                    /* Enable flexbox */
    flex-direction: row | column;     /* Main axis direction */
    justify-content: center;          /* Main axis alignment */
    align-items: center;              /* Cross axis alignment */
    flex-wrap: wrap | nowrap;         /* Item wrapping */
}
```

#### Item Properties

```css
.flex-item {
    flex-grow: 1;        /* How much to grow */
    flex-shrink: 1;      /* How much to shrink */
    flex-basis: auto;    /* Initial size */
    flex: 1;             /* Shorthand property */
}
```

### 3. Common Layout Patterns

- **Navigation bars** with `justify-content: space-between`
- **Card grids** with `flex-wrap: wrap`
- **Perfect centering** with `justify-content: center` + `align-items: center`
- **Responsive spacing** with `space-around` and `space-evenly`

## Activities for Students

### Part 1: Explore the Demo (L2.html)

1. **Open L2.html** in a browser
2. **Examine each section** and note the visual differences
3. **Resize the browser window** to see responsive behavior
4. **Inspect the code** to understand the CSS behind each example
5. **Experiment** by modifying properties in the browser dev tools

### Part 2: Complete the Exercise (L2Simple.html)

1. **Study the Figma screenshot** to understand the target layout
2. **Analyze the existing starter code**
3. **Add CSS properties** to recreate the design
4. **Test responsiveness** by resizing the browser
5. **Compare** your result with the reference image

## Exercise Solution Hints

For the pets layout in `L2Simple.html`:
- Use `display: flex` on the container
- Consider `justify-content` for spacing
- Add styling to `.petItem` for visual appeal
- Think about responsive behavior

## Extensions and Challenges

Students can try:
1. **Modify the pets layout** to be vertical instead of horizontal
2. **Add more pet items** and see how they wrap
3. **Create a navigation bar** using the patterns from L2.html
4. **Design a card layout** for different types of pets
5. **Add hover effects** and transitions
6. **Make it fully responsive** with different layouts for mobile/desktop

## Real-World Applications

### When to Use Flexbox:
- ✅ Navigation bars and menus
- ✅ Card layouts and galleries
- ✅ Centering content
- ✅ Responsive button groups
- ✅ Form layouts
- ✅ Equal-height columns

### Flexbox vs Other Layout Methods:
- **Flexbox**: Great for 1-dimensional layouts (rows or columns)
- **CSS Grid**: Better for 2-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)
- **Float/Position**: Legacy methods, avoid for modern layouts

## Design-to-Code Workflow

1. **Analyze the design** in Figma or other design tools
2. **Identify Auto Layout patterns** and responsive behaviors
3. **Plan the HTML structure** with containers and items
4. **Apply Flexbox properties** to recreate the layout
5. **Test and refine** for different screen sizes
6. **Add finishing touches** like spacing, colors, and typography

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Semantic HTML structure** with meaningful class names
- **Mobile-first responsive design** thinking
- **Consistent spacing** using margin and padding
- **Accessible design** with proper contrast and sizing
- **Clean, readable CSS** with comments and organization
- **Progressive enhancement** from basic to advanced features

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Items not centering?** Check both `justify-content` and `align-items`
- **Items too cramped?** Add `gap` property or margin/padding
- **Layout breaking on mobile?** Consider `flex-wrap: wrap`
- **Items different sizes?** Use `flex: 1` for equal sizing
- **Content overflowing?** Check `flex-shrink` and `min-width`

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson, students will be ready to:
- Create complex responsive layouts
- Understand CSS Grid for 2D layouts
- Build complete webpage layouts
- Work with CSS frameworks that use Flexbox
- Translate any design mockup into functional CSS
