# Simple JavaScript - Live Coding Lesson

## Lesson Overview
Hello! For this tutorial we're going to learn about JavaScript - what it is and how it can help you make a more useful website. We're going to be looking at only a few functions of JavaScript and we should note that JavaScript is a very complex, fully functioning programming language. We're just going to use a couple of features. What we should also note is that it is a programming language designed specifically for manipulating websites.

## How This Lesson Works - Live Coding Format

### For Teachers:
- Use VS Code Live Share to share your workspace with students
- Open `index.html` and demonstrate JavaScript concepts by adding code live
- Students can see your changes in real-time through Live Share
- Walk through examples step-by-step, explaining each concept as you code

### For Students:
- Clone or fork this repository to have your own copy
- Join the teacher's Live Share session to follow along
- Practice the concepts by coding along in your own `index.html` file
- You can experiment and make changes without affecting the shared session

## What We'll Learn

So we're going to look at a few things:

1. **First** - How we actually put a script into a program
2. **Second** - We're going to use the script to set an attribute of an element (in this case we're going to make a blue square turn red)
3. **Third** - We're going to change the script so that it will toggle the square red or blue. To make a toggle we're going to have to be able to read the current status of the square
4. **Finally** - We will look at making elements appear and disappear. This can be very useful for creating dropdowns, etc.

## Starting Point
The `index.html` file contains a basic HTML structure with:
- A styled div element (`#myTestDiv`) - our blue square
- Empty `<script>` tags ready for JavaScript code
- CSS styling for a centered blue box with white text

## Tips for Students
1. **Follow along actively** - don't just watch, code along!
2. **Ask questions** when you don't understand something
3. **Experiment** with variations of the code being demonstrated
4. **Save your progress** regularly as you learn new concepts
