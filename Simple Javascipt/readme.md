 mbn hello for this tutorial we're going to learn about JavaScript what it is and how it can help you make a more useful website. We're going to be looking at only a few functions of JavaScript and we should note that JavaScript is a very complex fully functioning programming language we're just going to use a couple of features, what we should also note is that it is a programming language designed specifically for manipulating website.

 So we're going to look at a few things first of all how we actually put a script into a program secondly we're going to use the script to set an attribute of an element in this case we're going to make a Blue Square turn red then we're going to change the script so that it will toggle the square red or blue to make a toggle we're going to have to be able to read the current status of the square

 the final thing that we'll do is we will look at making elements appear and disappear this can be very useful for creating drop downs etceteramega dropdowns
